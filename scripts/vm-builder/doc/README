vm-builder - A tool to automate virtual machine creation and setup.

Introduction
------------

This was originally created as a tool to scratch an itch. Creating new
virtual machines using VMWare Server is a manual process. Instead of using
vmware-server-console, why not write a script that does the same thing?


Installation
------------

1. Install vm-builder using the included rpm or a stable snapshot.

2. Run /usr/libexec/vm-builder/setup-vm-builder.sh. It will download
i386 and 64 bit CentOS images and set everything up for vm-builder to
work. The only thing it requires is a working ks.cfg on a server somewhere.

3. Use vmware-server-console to create linux disk images. Name the image
linux.vmdk and copy them to /home/vm-builder/template/linux/. An example
would be linux-s001.vmdk, linux-s002.vmdk, linux-s003.vmdk, and linux.vmdk.

3. Run vm-builder! The setup script gives you an example. Running it by
itsself will show you the images available for it to use. It will mount
the iso as a vmware drive, turn on the virtual machine, and start the
kickstart. After it is done, you should have a fresh install. Make sure
to have the 'rootpw' line in your ks.cfg so you can login as root.
