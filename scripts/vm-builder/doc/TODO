TODO as of Dec 18, 2007

	- Dig my head back into nroff and write a proper man page.

	- Write a cheesy Makefile to install it for those on the bleeding edge

	- Move these scripts to use libvirt's command line tools. This allows us
	  transparent support of Xen, Qemu, and KVM. (http://www.libvirt.org).
	  Backwards compatibility will stay in for VMWare GSX. This is a longterm
	  goal that won't happen anytime in the near future..

	- Better error checking of the disk images and gracefully recover from
	  failures when they were built incorrectly.
